Movie Search
This app uses React.js for rendering real time search results for movies.

App consists of two pages; first is movie search bar along with listing of movies and second one is details of movies (redirected by clicking on a movie from first page). 

Below the search bar on the first page, movies are listed with movie image, movie name and release date.

If user selects an item from listing page, the app is supposed to navigate the movie detail pages (second one).
